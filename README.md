# face-mask-project

## Overview
In this Project, We are building a Face Mask Detector using Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet and OpenCV. 
We will also see how to apply this on a Live Video Camera.
With further improvements these types of models could be integrated with CCTV cameras to detect and identify people without masks.

The face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since the MobileNetV2 architecture is used,
 itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).
